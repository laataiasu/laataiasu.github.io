she were medioker.
she used to write about something no one cares about.
but she try to improve
she try to wear hijab & hijrah because she thought its liberating
she fill her mind with Rābiʿa al-ʿAdawiyya, ayn rand, Simone de Beauvoir
she follow beauty influencer to get love.
she then get into  indonesia ivy league with degree in criminology
now she got into MBB.
got role in recruiment, support, and ops
her degree is useless

but fucked about it
her teeth is now glowing because of insurance
fancy dinner every week with college.
travel abroad once a month
tiktok story daily in my life 
to sip a cup of coffee with macbook (not laptop)

need to find hobby,
ohhh kpop is for freaky girl lack of love
movie is for drama queen
should find hobby that is acceptable by society
must be pop culture
who is most authentic pop star that is not normie but elegant
aahh i should go to concert. 

im independent woman
all guys are loser now. 
i can make money than any guys.
i made around 50 mil rupiahs.
ohh its just $3k, its lower classes in US.
does that mean im lower class?

ohh no
i should do charity
i should visit unlucky orphanage
and tell they should have a dream
and achieve their dreams like me.

and tell them 
only control something you can control
no social media
no read/hear/listening all negative news
genocide, incompetent politian, demonstration, poor people, criminal. 
all of them worthless
we just need to see the beauty in everything
positive positive positive

so their soul is complete like me. 
so we can forget everything that matter
after all 
what is that matter
I AM MATTER 

she tell herself everyday 
she look herself in the mirror
im beauty, i love myself, everything is perfect.
im happy, im happy.
ohh fuck lord im really happy.
