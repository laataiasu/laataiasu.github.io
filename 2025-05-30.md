the moment i try to build something genAI apps, the more i realized the limitation from it. there will be no perfect result or outputs. to test the output, what we can do is mostly using our intuition of good enough or not. its still depends on manual labelling and experts judgment, there will be no pure AI model that can directly like magic, you give input, and then give output as what youre expected. its so hard to be perfect.  



beberapa kesalahan yang saya lakukan adalah terlalu banyak menimbun knowledge. pre gen AI boom made me try to collect all informations i can, mostly i pirate contents from torrents. when in college most of the time i see courses, and try to follow. software engineering, data science, devops, trading, investing. i collect all of those things, i spend most of my time collecting. and when genAI booming, boom i find it useless thing to. i dont know whether its useless or not actually. sometimes when i interact with someone who is similar or equal age/background with me, when i try to bring topic i knows, most of them are clueless, even friends from my unviersity which is top university. i somehow realize the knowledge gaps. and i dont know whether this is something benefit or the drawback of just collecting knowledge. somehow you feel like you get nothing, but when you interact with someone, you somehow feel superior because they rarely know what you know.

and that makes me hard to see the reality, because its make me assuming that people collect information as much as i do. i assume people can get easily use terminal, while the truth, even most of my college friends are uncomfortable using terminal or linux.

and the drawback of it is i feel like i dont produce something meaningful. its very hard to quantify from external point of view. and i dont know its a really loss for me or not, but yeah sometimes i feel like its a loss.

and by that kind of black swan, i am afraid to do the same mistake. i feel like that i need to do something with effort, and then some event happens, and boom! that event makes me realize what im doing is useless, it made me like a luddite. i dont really want to be luddite.

i am afraid that my effort to be independent rich, to have financial freedom, is a futile aspects. because as we know the information is abundant now. more people lose jobs, i dont know whether UBI could be implement or not.

because, if there will be days where i dont need to father money anymore, than why should i continue this things. this is the bias of me. so one option is to have some backup but i dont want to be rely on the backup. sometimes i want to go all in, but i need to aware about the risk too. so thats why i am not 100% sure i need to continue to learn about quant finance. and i always search for something that really matters. bismillah, hope it wasnt all in vain.
