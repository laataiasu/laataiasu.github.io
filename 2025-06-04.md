today not really a good day.

just finished llm homework week 1 and tinkering about my laptop. nothing productive at all.

islam never makes sense for me, but i have been doctrined since i was born until now. i am very anxious related riba, even just 40k rupiahs for shopeepaylater. while politicans corrupts and are paid by lots of money using tax payer, what i can is just condemn and blame them without doing something. please help me to deconstruct so i can just like regular people, buy bank stocks, using credit card and paylater as long as it is for ethical use and not excessive. i hate inflation, i feel like i cant save money and really enjoy things, there's always anxious feeling that if i spent lots it made me poor and i should work for something i dont enjoy for the rest of my life.
