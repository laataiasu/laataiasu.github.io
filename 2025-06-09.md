Not very productice, but i found a little things i try to do, which is digital gardening.

i try to reorganize all my knowledge and experience. and the end game is similar with [[Movies/Transcendence|Transcendence]] ~ to make a clone of myself. 

digital gardening is just all i have consumed, the things i need is to integrate with all my journal apps, like tracker what i do from films, books, all contents ive consumed. 

i exploring speech processing framework too, how to create text to speech from my voice. 

all of these came from my conversation with chatgpt.
