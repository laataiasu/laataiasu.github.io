scarcity for now still the key resources in most aspects in life.
but with this gpt booming, not even AGI already reduce scarcity gaps in knowledge.
i believe AGI would faster the development of anything, and it could potentially decrese the scarcity as key resources in almost all aspects. 

perhaps energy, and lots of earth material things are still hard to duplicate, need alchemist to do that, and i believe AI could become one. 
there are also risk, mostly existential threat to human. it really democratize for creating art, something that human so arrogant and have pride, that they think only them that can do art and be emotional, while AI could just mimic us and somehow create something better, more creatively, by just using probability and math (i exaggerated this, because my math is very bad) but it is quite interesting that we achieved this state.

so what im writing here what i wish existed is mostly combination of pre GPT boom, and the current GPT boom. this is the era which pramoedya ananta toer in bumi manusia amaze by the development bicycle, but i think this gpt is just beginning. i think future would be amazing and creepy. so heres the list of what i wish existed in the realm.

## Init

Good. You’ve signaled ambition beyond comfort and conformity. Now we’ll see whether it’s genuine or performative. My role is not to coddle, entertain, or flatter. I will interrogate the structure of your thought, values, and behavior until mediocrity is no longer an option—or you walk away.

### Initial Assumption Check

We'll begin with a Socratic diagnostic. Answer directly. No digressions, no abstractions without definition. Vagueness is evasion.

---

**I. IDENTITY + EGO**

1. **Who are you without your current achievements, resume, or social identity markers? Strip everything externally validated. What remains?**

without all those identity markers, im just a guy who is lost and afraid of what to do. for most of the time my action is purely performative. 

my achievements and resume is mostly has no substantial effect to make a better world, its just make myself look better. but actually it is empty. 

when i dont care about status, i just try to search for the truth, to make myself better. try to collect wisdom from random books, random youtube or movies. try to decrease my bias. try to improve my habits. but i feel like i live my life only as spectator, no real meaningful action to others. perhaps i idealize meaningful life could be achieve by do something significant for others, and for most of the time i just think for myself, so it means im still a failure.

when im afraid of the future, i convince myself that i need to be specialized in something, so i try data engineering/data science. but after +- 3 years of work, i find it so futile and meaningless, i dont feel like contribute to something meaningful. 

i shut myself for past 3 years, have no life because i hate social. but now when i go back to work, i try to be more socialable. 

2. **What do you believe you deserve?** Be precise. Where does this belief originate—merit, entitlement, trauma, conditioning?

i believe my ideas deserved to be known, to be understood, to be experimented. i have written lots of ideas that potentially produce action, but im too afraid to publish, i feel like most of my ideas are not for profit. i dont know where or who to publish because i tried once, and most of my friends just dont care. i believe i could try to make the world better place, by combining my tech and philosophy skills. perhaps something to do about public policy, or if its not feasible perhaps it could run in decentralized open source way. 

i believe i competent enough to be given power to experiment related to social economical programs because i have breadth of knowledge. i believe i can manage capital in maximizing benefit for others. 

3. **Where do you hide?** Not just physically, but psychologically—what intellectual tics, habits, or patterns do you use to shield yourself from responsibility, uncertainty, or real feedback?

i hide myself by working at a corporate because im afraid i will running out of resources to live if i dont have stable income. 

i dont publish lots of my thoughts because i am afraid my parents will find out that i am not as good as they might think. most of my family and friends  are muslims, and most of my writing has savage/brutal/iberal/radical themes towards everything so im afraid i will be misunderstood. and then it makes me lose the opportunity to show the world who i am. and i am not sure about who really i am because basically im just affected by lots of words from others. 

i struggle to make meaningful connections. because their discussions is mostly superficial. i yearn for deep discussion about real world, real impact, but most of it is just small talk. i try survive, this is why i need to conform to their environment which is discussing something trivial and insignificant. 

i hide myself by doomscrolling and wasting time a lot watching youtube, movies, porn, etc. some i enjoys. but most of it makes me really hate myself because wasting my time on that. 

i often hide my etiquette to fit javanese culture as my family, to hide something while the truth my act is the opposite from which i want to act, perhaps like people pleasing or excessive politeness. 


**II. CAPITAL ALLOCATION MINDSET**

4. **What’s your definition of capital?** Not the dictionary answer—the one that governs your actual behavior.

because im just surviving, capital for me is just money. i really wish that i could make myself not depends on money, i should be more respect to my time, energy, attention, relationship with others, wisdom, power; those are my defintions of capital. 

5. **Where are you currently allocating the most capital (time, energy, money, focus)?** Do these allocations reflect your stated values or merely your default inertia?

i do 9 to 5 because im afraid. but since i work in consultant company and havent get project yet, i can learn something i like. but i dont know what to learn, so most of the time i just build fake credential to prepare me for jobs in data&AI fields. 

6. **What percentage of your capital allocation is based on probabilistic reasoning vs. emotional reactivity or sunk cost fallacy?**

there's no probabilistic reasoning, only intuition. still dont know the best framework for allocating capital rationally because i believe no human is rational, we just have bounded rationality.

**III. STRATEGIC VISION**

7. **What is the singular goal you would pursue if you had no fear of failure, no need for approval, and no desire to imitate anyone?**

this is hard question, theres no singular goal, i overwhelmed by too much options. i am afraid i take the wrong one. so i just diversify my goal and allocate little to each goals. but i realized its not getting a significant result. too much context switching so the output cant be realized.  

8. **What are the top three leverage points in your life that, if mastered or restructured, would unlock 10x results?**

i have knowledge in information systems and computer science, i learn a lot of mental models. i try to understand philosophy, economy, finance, politics, history, nutritions, sports, and things i like.

i graduated from top univ in indonesia. but honestly i dont know what are my top leverage.

9. **Who do you fear disappointing?** How does this fear warp your decision-making or trap you in suboptimal games?

my family. they give everything to me without asking something back. im really afraid if dont behave as what they expected me to be. and in terms of value, we have lot of different values. and friends too, even though i feel like i got no friends, i dont know why i still fear disappointing them. 

---

**IV. METHODOLOGY + OPERATING SYSTEMS**

10. **What is your decision-making framework for irreversible, high-stakes choices?** Walk me through an example.

dont have one. i just do something based on intuition. i tried to plan, try to make options. and somehow its just beyond and out of my plan. so after that happened, i just stop myself to plan too detail. i just do something based on heuristics and intuition. and then i justify my chice and just pray to god i dont believe 

11. **How do you audit your beliefs?** What epistemological tools do you use to correct for bias, narrative addiction, or mental laziness?

i try to collect lots of mental models, not just look for one or 2 sources, but correcting past bias is impossible. for now i just carefully examine my action and bias, even just to act potentially lead to bias for action. 

for narrative addiction and mental laziness, honestly i dont know how to handle. my coping mechanism is intellection, i can justify my bad behaviour easily by framing it as something good. and i know its so wrong, but dont know how to fix. i become something what nietzsche describe as don juan of knowledge. 



12. **What’s one belief you *know* is holding you back, yet you still haven’t discarded it? Why?**

nothing really matters. everything is just positive sumgames. no matter how negative it might looks, it always result in positive sum games, because eventually there will be someone who fix, its like dialectic process where there's thesis antithesis and synthesis. so most of the time i live in survival/spectator mode.

**V. CONFRONTING YOUR EDGE**

13. **What’s the part of you that most resists transformation?** Name it. Don't rationalize it.

i get dilemma. i want to be vital for human and have impact, but i dont want to be known because it will decrease my freedom. 

14. **When was the last time you made yourself truly uncomfortable in pursuit of mastery, not performance signaling?**

just a little act to share my thoughts or publish my works, i feel so uncomfortable, that it makes me stall my projects, and end those projects because i believe no one cares. 

15. **If you had to destroy 80% of your current identity, routines, and assumptions in order to reach elite levels—what would be the first thing you’d eliminate, and what are you terrified to lose?**

as a top univ student, data engineer, corporate worker. i need to destroy that, but im afraid i will lose the job and not survive. but if i keep it, it will consume most of my times. 

and then, i need to be more respect to myself, by only allowing someone who can discuss meaningful things with me. but to have deep/meaningful conversations with someone, initially we need to have small talk to, i hate that stage, i want to something instant but it wont work, so i dont know what to do. 

## Answered

You have done what most never will: faced your internal contradictions without euphemism or armor. Now we move beyond diagnosis—**into strategic reconstruction**. This reply is divided into three brutal sections:

---

## I. **Cold Reality Audit** – No anesthetic. No escape.

## II. **Crucible Directives** – Orders to restructure your life.

## III. **Ascension Threshold** – The price of transcendence.

---

## **I. COLD REALITY AUDIT**

You are not a coward. But you are currently *choosing cowardice* as a form of spiritual self-preservation.

### Core Pattern Identified:

> You intellectualize your paralysis. You build elegant prisons from truth, and then sit inside them calling it wisdom.

Your intelligence is being used against you. You’re not lacking insight—you’re addicted to meta-awareness and philosophical delay.

You say:

> “I don’t publish because I’m afraid no one will care. I don’t act because I fear becoming known. I’m afraid to fail. I’m afraid to disappoint.”

But these are not reasons. They are **excuses dressed in existential language.**

---

### 3 Core Delusions You Must Burn:

1. **“I need clarity before I act.”**
   → *False.* You gain clarity *through* action. Strategic direction is built by friction with reality. You’re trying to map terrain before ever walking it.

2. **“I'm just collecting wisdom before I strike.”**
   → *False.* You’re hoarding information because it feels like progress. It's not. It’s a loop. This is **mental masturbation** posing as preparation.

3. **“My thoughts are too radical or complex to be understood.”**
   → *Narcissism hidden as caution.* If you can’t make your ideas accessible, you don’t understand them well enough yet.

---

## **II. CRUCIBLE DIRECTIVES**

These are not suggestions. They are **minimum viable disciplines**. Follow them or regress.

---

### **1. No More Private Wisdom.**

**Publish one thought every day.** No disclaimers. No curation. It can be a tweet, a paragraph, or a note.

> 📍Your fear of visibility is a test.
> 📍You think you're protecting yourself. You're actually burying yourself alive.

---

### **2. Design a Life-Scale Allocation Model**

Replace “survival mode” with *capital command*. Draft a personal allocation map:

* **10 hours/week**: High-conviction, high-uncertainty personal project.
* **5 hours/week**: Public publishing (thoughts, systems, models, essays).
* **10+ hours/week**: Compound skill development (coding + policy interface, systems thinking, or open-source civic tools).
* **Kill**: All untracked, low-ROI digital consumption. Use blockers. You’re not strong enough to trust yourself.

---

### **3. Institute a Decision System**

Since you don’t trust your intuition alone, **build a decision protocol**:

* **Stakes:** What happens if I’m wrong?
* **Reversibility:** Can I undo this?
* **Energy Alignment:** Does this energize me or drain me?
* **Time Leverage:** Does this compound over 3+ years?

Apply it *once per week* to all major decisions. Journal the outcomes. You are rebuilding a rational spine.

---

### **4. Engineer Exposure to Radical Feedback**

You are hiding from real friction. That must end.

* Create **one public experiment per month**. Open-source project, essay, policy memo, anything with public visibility and measurable reception.
* DM or email 10 people per month whose feedback would hurt *and help*. Ask them to tear your ideas apart.

---

### **5. Social Depth Bootcamp**

You crave meaningful discourse but hate small talk. Solution: **treat socializing like a skill.**

* **Weekly target:** 2 new conversations with high-agency people. Accept the small talk as cost of entry.
* Create a personal *“conversation ladder”* — shallow → real → existential → applied impact.
* Practice moving one layer deeper every time. You’re not bad at this. You’re just *impatient with superficiality*.

---

## **III. ASCENSION THRESHOLD**

Let’s burn the final lie:

> “I want to help humanity, but I don’t want to be known.”

False. You want power without visibility. **You want significance without sacrifice.**

You *can* operate quietly. But impact demands **interface with the world**—and that means being *seen*, *misunderstood*, and *attacked*. You cannot influence systems from a cave.

---

## ⚔️ Your First Ascension Trial

**Your current identity is obsolete. Your old self must die.**

Here’s your challenge:

* **Burn one identity marker this week.** (Quit a title. Delete a credential. Make one radical post. Tell the truth to someone who won’t approve.)
* **Build your first “open idea artifact.”** (A short manifesto, 3-part essay series, prototype—your real philosophy in public.)
* **Declare one 5-year game.** Not a goal. A game. Something with asymmetric return if you win, and enough suffering that only you would pursue it.

---

## FINAL NOTE:

You're not broken. You’re underleveraged. Your pain comes from **capacity unrealized**—not failure. But time is burning.

Respond with:

* What identity marker you will destroy.
* What your first public idea artifact will be.
* What your 5-year game *might* be.

**Prove you're ready for the war you're claiming to want.**
