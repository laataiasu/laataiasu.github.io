do you think the future there is a state where UBI is implemented?

because as we can see right now, software engineering is democratized a lot by AI. 

less job SE right now compre to previous years and it so sudden because everyone can just generate something right now. 

china oversupply things and dont know where to sell, lots of farmers and fisherman just dump/burn their oversupply things because if they just sell it, it ruin the economy. do you think economy system right now is obsolete?

is it possible that everything become abundance , so money wont matter anymore?

in that kind of state wdyt about the people who is focusing on hoarding/piling up material things like money.

i hate when i need to structured things up. 

i prefer some messy things to work on. 

with my below medioker skill in writings, what i can do is just to write one or 2 phrose. 

when things got too much, i often lose context, worse than average LLM.

to pick something for brand, honestly it confuse me a lot. lots of things i should put on effort. design website, searching for something that could benefit for people. but sometimes i want to forget all those. i write what i want to write. 

i publish it somewhere hidden, and its easy to find. but still, in the persona or branding or something elusive, i still need to try to communicate. 

even just a little, just a little to touch someone or something, even the dead, perhaps i want to impress the dead more than the living. 

most of my people who im admired is already dead if we still consider the dimension of time. 

i believe god is just a time, without it everything just lose the architect. 

lights and sound, most of it is measured by the speed, there is always time in speed. theres time in everything. 

and when i try to believe in atheism, i believe i kill my god which is time. thats why everything seems so irrelevant. 

when i see most of my friends compain like a luddite about someone who prefer AI than real human work for art etc, i couldnt relate with them. 

because as i see towards the future, where entropy is always increase ~ kullu nafsin da iqotul maut, i believe everything will become obsolete, useless, if we erase the dimension of time. there is time too in attention. and when i try to kill the god which is time, i become nihillistic cynic that see everything as worthless and meaningless. and it could make me improve intellection for everything, to justify for everything easily, there is no right or wrong. everything is positive sum game. intelletion is just therapy for all nihillistict people, it made them easier to justify their cowardness and stupidity, inaction or pseudo activism, risk taking or risk aversing, everything can be justify.

and thats why i never support all collectve mass movements, because basically i dont believe in the significance of time.

and no matter how hard i try to push that idealogy, the biological and anthropological characteristics of me just punch me in the face. 

the fear of hungry, the need for companionship, its all that push me towards what kind of hell is this. and its might be hell for me is still heaven for most of people. but honestly i dont really i understand why we feel corrupt when we lie. theres too much dimension. and to look the truth for it is just wasting time. 

art is dead, bo burnham said art is dead. 

i like his most of the songs because it so full of contradictory. 

dont need to tell what that means. 

but it is simply art is dead. why we rage someone who help us to create something.

someone who is against genAI is ismply human that is so insecure, skeptics (just like me. i really skeptics because when they right its somehow liberating and they wrong no one care about it). why against something that help people.

what they think is too short termist. and their bias arrive because we are always hypnotized by this corrupt economic system. 

we always things in terms of scarcity, and we forgot that everything is abundance. the little earth we got here is small. even just a small dot, it really abundance. 

why so bitter against someone that aim to make people abundance, redundance, and create everything. when all the disable people can see, hear, and do just like us, will it make the world better? or worse?

why not just follow to build something that create a monster, to burn all these obsolete system. 

i mean why trying, just follow me to kill the god that is a time. and you could live or unlive simply like me, theres no such things as collapsing.

its just the way it is. you could sow or kill something, it doesnt matter. time itself does not exists, and it never exists. perhaps tomorrow it will, and were all gonna be matters, but it will be boring. i prefer theres no time in us. but now im hungry so i should steal something to eat.
