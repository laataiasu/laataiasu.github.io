intro

- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

i have just realize i go to univ not because i want to, its because i am told to do.

i not choose the major i really interested, i choose it because im afraid become poor and jobless.

i work not because i want to, but because im afraid im looked useless by people.

every choose and decision i make is mostly because im afraid of what is social construct.

and it leave me become miserable.

now i quit the mundane job i got, now i say no to people i have no respect. now i become unemploye, i try to break frmo all of these things that makes me miserable. 

i try to ask myself everyday, if money isnt an issue, what will i gonna do. its been 3 months and i still could find the answer. 

i try to ask question what im valuing most, and i dont really know about. i understand that value and meaning is subjective human creation. 

and now i am circling here, dont know what to do, dont know what i want. it makes me miserable too. 

then i see time.fun. everything seems like can be tokenized. i hope someone create token that tokenize my misserableness, but i think it will have no value since it could become infiinity.

but as you see, in this era of speculation, people can do long on short of everything, my miserable could fluctuate, perhaps i could make it as little as possible so it become scarce, and only the meaningful and valueable misserable that exist, so perhaps it could become valuable? 

and when people start trade short my miserableness to the point of it doesnt exist, what people get in returns. will they get a lot of loss? but i must assure, that my misserable must have a value, it wont go to 0 or to become void

i understand i must choose miserable that is valuable to be exchanged by miserable that is not valuable. for that i believe my misebrable could be trade, its dynamic, its struggle, its beauty, i believe it could be trackd eternally in our digital world. to prove that i have miserable that is beautiful.
