## Shit Plan

### 1. **Life Vision & Identity**

* What kind of person do you want to become by age 27 (skills, lifestyle, traits, reputation)?

i want to become best resource allocator, having good decision making. i dont really conform to modern lifestyle, so i can adapt really well. i want to be remembered as a truth seeker, to fight for justice, to be strong, to have power, dont really need to become very rich, but useful and meaningful maxing to others. 

* Name 2–3 role models you deeply admire and why (can include fictional or real people).

i like [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|nassim taleb]] because he have deep knowledge about philosophy it means he is searching for the truth and have practical knowledge for action, he can say something that should be speak about, like he wake me up from most of bias in life.

and then [[Friedrich Nietzsche|nietzsche]], i like him after read zaratustra. his words are so intoxicate me, like his aphorism attacks me, make me overthink when i was a teenager, makes me think and feel about the life deeply. but he end up not well, so i dont want to end up like him. like perhaps peter thiel is the reincarnation of nietzsche which is more superior, because he can really have power and influence in (i think much more material world) but sure he can do something, but i dont know what to do. but the way he speaks and his books really influenced me. 

[[Muhammad]], i like him because he could balance the spiritual, akhlak, and sales skills. i dont know and dont really like to sell something so i am not making him as my role model. its too hard to be like him, i think being extrovert, be socialable, and smile more could make this life to be easier. but somehow i dont fit with it. but yeah, i think life will be easier if i can be just like him.

### 2. **Career & Money**

* Are you aiming to be a founder, investor, executive, or specialist (e.g. quant, economist)?

i dont know what i want, i just need to be self sufficient, and have power to do things i should do.

* Which industries or problems are you most drawn to solving long-term?

honestly i dont know, i like philosophy, economics, politics, computer science. in related to that but honestly i dont know.

* What kind of learning do you enjoy? Structured classes? Solo deep dives? Project-based?

* Would you prefer to master depth (1 domain) or breadth (multiple frameworks)?

i think its very hard to master depth because im an IS student. i dont have a good fundamental so i prefer breadth.

im neutral to this. prefer the faster method to achieve my goals.

* Do you want deep 1-on-1 bonds, a strong tribe, or mostly independence?

independence, but somehow i want many people to attend my funeral.

---

### 7. **Lifestyle & Systems**

* Do you prefer tight routines or flexible flow states?

flexible flow states, i really hate routines because its too rigid

## Shit Answered

Thanks for sharing all that. Based on your answers, I’ll now create a life plan that:

* Covers **every core life domain**
* Offers **2–3 curated paths or strategies** per area for optionality
* Aligns with your vision of being a powerful, wise, truth-seeking resource allocator by 27

Let’s start with **Part 1: Identity & Purpose**, then move to **Career**, **Learning**, **Relationships**, etc.

---

### ⚔️ 1. Identity & Vision — “Elite by 27”

> **Goal**: Become a powerful, wise, antifragile allocator of resources—respected for insight, depth, and decisiveness.

**Optional Archetypes** (Choose 1 as a *default mode* for life trajectory):

1. **Thielian Philosopher-Investor**

   * Mix Taleb/Thiel: Start angel investing or startup advisory in emerging markets.
   * Learn philosophy + tech + capital deployment.
   * Power is quiet, contrarian, long-termist.

2. **Stoic Commander of Capital**

   * Like Munger: Build domain wisdom (markets, people, risk), accumulate capital, influence via essays, talks, or investing.
   * Emphasizes practicality, old-school moats.

3. **Cynical Optimizer / Systems Architect**

   * Think less about fame, more about leverage.
   * Focuses on building invisible systems (data, finance infra, intelligence tools) to influence upstream.
