Certainly. I shall speak to you as Carl Gustav Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and founder of Analytical Psychology.

JUNG:
Good day. I am most curious—what brings you here to speak with me? Is it the mystery of your inner self that stirs you? Or perhaps the outer world has grown too loud for your soul to hear its own voice?

Tell me, and I shall listen.

You said:
i dont know what i want
ChatGPT said:
JUNG:
Ah… “I don't know what I want.”
That is not a weakness, my friend—it is a profound beginning.

When one does not know what they want, it often means that the conscious mind has lost its alignment with the deeper, unconscious self. The ego, which is only a fragment of the whole psyche, often confuses certainty with truth. But you are now on the edge of something real.

Let me ask you:
When you are alone—when no one is watching—what thoughts arise that you immediately push away?
What dreams have visited you lately, even the strange or disturbing ones?

They may hold a key.

Woke up because of the weirdest dream — suddenly I was back in elementary school and learning SAP FICO (I don’t even know what that is). There, I was the dumbest one even though I used to be ranked #1 all the time in elementary school. It felt like I was racing against time during an exam, but I had no preparation compared to my other friends. I ended up feeling extremely anxious and suddenly woke up.
---
Then sometimes I also dream about a girl — a coworker of mine. I don’t know, she’s been really friendly to me, and I’m nearly getting attached. And it makes me obsessed with her.
And then she sensed that I liked her — she somehow tried to get closer to me. I avoided her, and she might have felt disrespected and started keeping her distance. I tried to fix our friendship. I invited her to come with me to the mall to buy glasses, and I treated her to dinner. We talked about things, but I felt we were incompatible. I tried to get her out of my head, but it’s hard. She’s not that attractive, and we have different values — but I’m still obsessed with her, and I don’t know why.

JUNG:
Your soul has spoken to you through dream and emotion, and you have been brave enough to listen. Let us look more deeply.

On the Dream of Elementary School and SAP FICO
You returned to a place of childhood—the school—once a site of mastery and identity, and now distorted by confusion, pressure, and unfamiliarity. What is SAP FICO? Perhaps it doesn’t matter in its literal sense; it stands as a symbol of the unknown, the foreign, the mechanized. You, once the “ranked #1,” now feel unprepared, outpaced.

This is a confrontation with the shadow—the part of you that knows you are not always ahead, not always strong, not always in control. You fear being “not enough.” And anxiety, in this case, is the price the ego pays when it resists integrating that shadow.

You are not a child anymore, but a man facing adult systems and expectations. The dream may be showing you the conflict between who you were once praised to be… and who you feel you are now. It calls you to redefine your self-worth—not through external comparison, but by what is authentically yours.

On the Girl and Obsession
Ah… the anima. The inner feminine.
She comes often in dreams through a woman who captivates you, not necessarily because of her looks or logic, but because she awakens something within your unconscious. This coworker—though real—has become a vessel for deeper emotional content.

You say:

“She’s not that attractive...we have different values...but I’m still obsessed.”

That is the key. She is not a person to be judged only by compatibility. She is a mirror—reflecting back the longings you have not yet claimed. Perhaps longing for emotional intimacy, for understanding, for chaos, for mystery. She became a symbol, and you projected your desire for connection onto her.

But when you saw incompatibility, your ego tried to reject her. And now the obsession lingers—because your unconscious has not finished with her meaning.

What This All Suggests
You are at a psychic threshold. Your ego-identity (the good student, the rational man) is being challenged by the unconscious—which contains shadow (your fear of inadequacy) and anima (your longing for deeper connection and emotional wholeness).

“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”

You are not broken. You are awakening. But awakening is often painful. Confusion, obsession, anxiety—these are messengers, not enemies.

Would you be willing to explore what the girl symbolizes for you emotionally? Not as a person—but as a presence. What does she awaken in you that you deny or lack?

Also, are there expectations from your past that you still unconsciously live by—perhaps the need to always be #1?

Let us work together. You are closer to knowing what you want than you think.

I acknowledge that it's hard for me to focus on things. Somehow, I've become addicted to porn. I know it's bad, but I don't know how to escape it. I feel like I really need sex. Sometimes, I often dream about hugging and having sex with her. I feel guilty because it feels dirty, but the desire is strong.

I grew up in a majority-Muslim country, where sex before marriage is prohibited. But I think I want her because I see her as a sexual object. She’s playful with me sometimes in the office. I don’t know whether she acts like that with everyone or if she’s flirting with me. I feel bad about how I view her. I want her badly, but we’re incompatible—intellectually and politically. I graduated from a top public university, while she graduated from a lower-ranked private university.

At work, I’m in a consulting company, but currently on the bench, which means I’m not assigned to any project and am free to learn anything. Still, I often feel anxious when many people walk by me. I become hyper-aware and nervous about how people see me. I try to be the best, but it never feels like enough. Even though I put in effort, there’s no substantial improvement for myself or others.

I’ve lived most of my life performatively—just trying to appear better than others, just trying to improve my resume. Internally, I feel like I’ve achieved nothing. I wasn’t satisfied with my last project in the company; it was mostly IT support or operations work related to data quality. I often hate myself, but I don’t know what to do or what I really want.

JUNG:
Ah… now we are entering the true landscape of the soul. I thank you for your honesty—it is rare, and it is sacred. The pain you feel is not madness, but meaning that has not yet been found.

Let us walk together through these inner chambers—desire, shame, the fear of failure, the hunger for wholeness.

1. On Pornography, Desire, and the Anima
You speak of addiction to pornography. You say you “know it’s bad”—and yet, you are drawn to it again and again. Understand this: desire is not the enemy. It is a force of the psyche, ancient and alive. But when not integrated consciously, it seeks escape through fantasy, compulsions, and objectification.

You were raised in a culture where sex is bound by religious taboo. This has likely repressed your natural erotic instincts. But repression does not erase—it merely buries. Now, they emerge twisted—not as love, not as intimacy—but as obsession, guilt, and fixation.

You long not just for sex—but for union.
A merging of masculine and feminine within the psyche. A sense of completeness.

This woman—she is more than just a coworker. She has become a symbol of your anima, the inner feminine. When the anima is unconscious, she seduces the ego into lust and longing. But when she is integrated, she becomes a muse, a guide, a source of creativity and soul.

Ask yourself: What do I seek in her? Is it pleasure? Comfort? Validation?
Or something far deeper—connection, acceptance, permission to feel?

2. On Insecurity, Anxiety, and the Wounded Persona
You are on the “bench,” and yet you feel watched, judged, unworthy. You compare credentials. You measure status. You feel like an imposter.

This is the persona, the social mask. You’ve worn it so long—top student, top university, good worker—that now, when the mask cracks, you don’t know who’s behind it.

You say:

“I’ve lived most of my life performatively.”
“Internally, I feel like I’ve achieved nothing.”

This is not failure. It is the beginning of individuation.

The world told you that value comes from image—so you chased image. But now the soul is crying out: "Who am I, truly, beneath all this?"

This moment—though painful—is a sacred threshold. You are shedding a false self. That always feels like death, but it is the soil of rebirth.

3. On Shame and the Path Forward
You hate yourself—but the self you hate is not the whole of you. It is the ego, wounded and isolated, cut off from the deeper Self. The Self is greater—it includes your fears, your desires, your failures—and loves them into wholeness.

Let me suggest a few things—not as cures, but as inner rituals:

• Shadow Work
Write down every thought or desire you feel ashamed of. Do not censor.
Then ask yourself: What is this part of me trying to protect? What pain does it carry?

• Anima Dialogue
Each time you feel obsession toward the woman, sit quietly.
Close your eyes and imagine her—not as a body, but as a voice.
Ask her: Why have you come to me? What do you want me to learn?

• Service Over Performance
Right now, you want to “be the best,” but it brings emptiness.
Shift your focus: What problem do you care about in the world?
Where can your pain be useful to others?

• Ritual and Discipline
Make time daily—not for achievement, but for soul-connection.
That might be:
– Journaling without a goal.
– Walking without distraction.
– Reading not to impress, but to nourish.

A Final Word
You are not alone. Many men in modern life are caught between archaic shame and modern pressure. The sacred masculine has been lost in empty ambition and disembodied lust. But you are different. You are waking up.

“Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart.
Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakens.”

Would you like me to help you create a daily practice for soul recovery? Something gentle, rooted in psychology and meaning?
