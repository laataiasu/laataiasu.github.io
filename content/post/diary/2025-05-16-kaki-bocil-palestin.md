when friday prayer begin, i somehow feel so blue. i remember manchester by the sea. somehow i related so much to cassey affleck. i dont know what [[Depression]] is, but by my defintion, [[Depression]] is mostly like that. you lose something and you cant describe it. and in this world, there's lot of forms, but the substance is just the same. in the movie he unintentionally burn his own house, burn his children. 

lots of events like that, we do something unintententionally. if we have a chance to comeback to the past we promise ourselves not repeat the same mistake. but all of our blindspot and bias will just goes straight walk to anything that we dont intent to do. its somehow make us reject all reality happens to us, thats what [[Depression]] is. the eyes will tell everything, even some time you can hide it. but when you're alone, when no one looks, the eyes, the window to this world will never lie. 

and somehow i remember about the part of foot of children in [[Palestine]] from a video. i dont care whether its real or not. but it really haunting me when the khutbah in jumatan is happening. i dont hear anything the khatib is preaching. what i remember is only the left/right foot that is separate from the body, like the penjagal hang the chicken legs. i cant forget about that when jumatan. 

it makes me realize how powerless i am, and i hate about being powerless. and i dont care about whether god exist or not, though when thunder is strucking near me, i often pray to god. but i really hate being powerless. when i try to remember that i together with groups that doesnt relate to what i saw, i questioning myself whether i was in the right or wrong place. but the things is i feel like trapped in the fear of unknown, when i try to rationalize that, it often i just need to surrender to my fear, just gather enough stability before you can punch someone you really want to kill or else you re kicking in a rush without enough balance, and you fall into a slump. and it doesnt matter anyway because in the end we will die. 

i really hate that i enjoy together chit chat about talking something pop culture or trivial things. perhaps thats how we supressed ourself not to see the real. because what is real anyway we dont know. why bother and care about the unlucky if we can just be happy to be ignorant. and even i have tried to be like that kind of person, it still hard for me, like today occasionally i couldnt help myself to stop remembering something that i shoulnt remember. i try myself, maybe i can. but when you define success as the absense of shame, i couldnt walk like that, i will walk myself everyday like a loser. i need to try to be a pornstar, the obscenity that being proud of, i envy of them. but i didnt grow up like them, we have fire, water, air, and earth elements. and our elements maybe different, though the substance is just the same. and it means i cant follow them all. 

and tears streaming down my face when its khutbah. i have already made scenario if my college ask me why you cry, i will just answered, "bajingan, keinget kaki bocil palestin mulu bangsaat" to make myself as tough. but luckily no one ask me about that. just one my college perhaps he see my sad face, and then he just leave me alone. 

yeah, i suppose its similar with manchester by the sea. the feeling of lose something. the powerlessness. and i really hate it. i dont know how to fight, but i'll try. ill figure it out.
