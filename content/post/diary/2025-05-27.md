felt like not really productive today. i dont know what i should pursue. quant finance seems so abstract and not practical. i search things that combine [[Indonesia]] market and [[Computer Science]] things is hard, and that is actually the opportunity to bring something. but i find it hard to find the track. perhaps i need to start from CFA or CQF, but honestly i find it confusing to apply it to [[Indonesia]] market. like i still dont know how to screen the stocks i should buy. 


i need to implement quant finance in [[Indonesia]] market, but even just getting the [[Data]] is very hard, idx is expensive, yfinance i dont whether its realiable or not. do you thinks its possible or is it better to play in the market that is very efficient like in US? and im starting from scratch, what are the stakeholders, concepts, and everything i should now. 


That’s an exceptional wish — you're aiming for the **perfect rational agent**, akin to an omniscient trader, philosopher, or strategist. Let’s simulate your **Mental Gym** to train for that:

---

## 🧠 "Mental Gym" – AI Prompt Stations

> *Train like an agent optimizing over beliefs, strategy, and reality.*

Each station targets a core **cognitive faculty** you need to dominate:

| Station                         | Skill Trained                               | AI Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Epistemic Rigor**          | Truth-seeking, belief updates               | “Here’s a belief I hold: X. Critique it from multiple lenses — statistical, evolutionary, economic, philosophical. What’s the strongest version I’m missing?”                                           |
| 🧠 **Bayesian Calibration**     | Probabilistic thinking                      | “Give me 10 real-world questions (e.g. future events, political outcomes) and ask me to estimate probabilities. Then show me how to recalibrate after new info.”                                        |
| 📈 **Expected Utility Mastery** | Decision-making under risk                  | “I face this decision: \[describe options, risks, desires]. Model it as an expected utility problem. How do different utility functions or discount rates change my action?”                            |
| 🧩 **Game Theory & Strategy**   | Multi-agent optimization                    | “I’m playing a repeated game in X context (e.g. politics, [[Investment|investing]], career). Model the incentive structure and dominant strategies. What’s the optimal meta-play?”                                     |
| 🔄 **Meta-Rationality**         | Switching between frames                    | “I’m trying to choose between 3 models: X, Y, Z. For each, what assumptions am I making? What type of questions does each reveal or obscure?”                                                           |
| ⛩️ **Philosophical Grounding**  | Meaning, ethics, axioms                     | “Let’s assume I must build a value function that reflects what’s *worth maximizing* over a lifetime. What’s the philosophical basis for each candidate (e.g., virtue, legacy, pleasure, power, truth)?” |
| ⚙️ **Information Design**       | What to seek, track, or ignore              | “I want to refine my information diet to only ingest things that compound decision quality and insight. Based on my goals, what should I prioritize, ignore, or actively avoid?”                        |
| 🧮 **Counterfactual Mastery**   | What-if scenario generation                 | “Assume I took path X instead of Y five years ago. Trace the likely consequences backward and forward. What does this reveal about regret-minimization or model error?”                                 |
| 🧘 **Cognitive Anti-fragility** | Emotional detachment, learning from failure | “Simulate a future where I make a critical error in judgment and lose status or money. What is the correct mental posture and what can be systematized for future robustness?”                          |

## 🔁 Suggested Usage (Weekly Mental Gym Routine)

* **Pick 1 station/day** — e.g., do "Bayesian Calibration" on Monday
* **Log outputs in Obsidian/Notion**
* **Rate clarity 1–10** after each session
* **Every 2 weeks**: summarize biggest model update and new action taken

## ⚔️ Bonus "Boss Level" Prompt

> You vs. GPT = sparring against a higher-level intelligence
> Use this to simulate ultra-competent advisors or ruthless adversaries.

```text
Act as a superintelligent philosopher-strategist with zero tolerance for mediocrity or self-delusion. My goal is to become an elite allocator of capital, ideas, and meaning.
Ruthlessly audit my current assumptions, habits, identity, and blindspots. Challenge me with a diagnostic interview, Socratic-style, until I break or ascend.
```

## 🧭 Next Step?

I can:

1. Build this as a **Notion Template** with a dashboard
2. Turn it into a **daily chatbot flow** for Telegram or local setup
3. Design a **custom 30-day regimen** with themes and increasing difficulty

Which one do you want next?

i am very afraid of publish my writing because im afraid i will be judge. i grow with persona that im a religious person but my writing really liberal. is it part of lose averse bias?

the thing is im not sure whether its something i should keep it to myself for journaling or can i publish it. and i dont know is it approriate if i publish. but deep down i really want someone to know what i write
