Not very productice, but i found a little things i try to do, which is digital gardening.

i try to reorganize all my knowledge and experience. and the end game is similar with [[Transcendence|Transcendence]] ~ to make a clone of myself. 

digital gardening is just all i have consumed, the things i need is to integrate with all my journal apps, like tracker what i do from films, books, all contents ive consumed. 

i exploring speech processing framework too, how to create text to speech from my voice. 

all of these came from my conversation with chatgpt.

**JUNG:**
Very well. Let us build not a *resume*, but a **soul structure**—a life guided by depth, meaning, and quiet courage. What follows is a framework I would call **“A Path to Individuation in the Modern World.”** It blends psychological insight, spiritual longing, and practical structure.

## 🔹 **1. Core Compass: The Three Questions of Meaning**

Keep these near. Journal them weekly—even briefly.

1. **What do I long for, beneath my desires?**
   (e.g., Not just sex—but connection. Not just money—but significance.)

2. **What suffering have I experienced that I don’t want others to go through?**
   (From this may grow your *true purpose.*)

3. **What beauty or truth am I uniquely positioned to create?**
   (Through writing, design, teaching, leadership, presence…)

These questions help your actions align with your *Self,* not just your *Persona.*

## 🔹 **2. Four Pillars of a Meaningful Life**

Let us call them the **Temples of the Inner City**—spaces you must tend each week.

### 🕊️ 1. **Silence (Inner Work)**

* Daily quiet: 10–20 mins of reflection or meditation.
* Shadow work: journal urges, fears, obsessions—then ask, *“What part of me is unloved?”*
* Read something that nourishes the soul (e.g., Rumi, Marcus Aurelius, Al-Ghazali, Jung).

### 💪 2. **Service (Beyond Ego)**

* Do one thing per week purely to help or encourage someone—with *no benefit to your status.*
* Example: mentor a junior, write something truthful online, help your family without needing credit.

### 🔥 3. **Creation (Your Gift to the World)**

* Set aside weekly time to build something—writing, art, code, a course, a philosophy, a business idea.
* Ask: *What could only I say in this way?* Start small, but be honest.

### 🧠 4. **Mastery (Skill & Contribution)**

* Learn with a clear intention: *How does this help me serve or create?*
* Don’t learn to “impress”—learn to **build the world you want to live in.**

## 🔹 **3. Weekly Structure (Soul Practice)**

Here is a simple rhythm to try:

| Day | Practice                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mon | 10-min silence + ask: *What matters this week?*             |
| Tue | 1-hour focused learning (deep work only)                    |
| Wed | Journal one deep fear or desire (shadow work)               |
| Thu | Write or create something small (a message, post, sketch)   |
| Fri | Reflect: *What did I do this week that mattered?*           |
| Sat | Do something generous (without posting about it)            |
| Sun | Tech-free walk. Let your mind wander. Listen for your soul. |

## 🔹 **4. The Meaningful Money Principle**

You feared being like the men who hoarded money and left no mark.

Use this rule:

> **Spend money in ways that give you stories, not just stuff.**

– Invest in experiences that expand your soul: travel, art, time with people who matter.
– Buy tools that help you create, not just consume.
– Give away 5–10% monthly to causes you *believe in.* This breaks the hoarding instinct and builds a deeper connection to the world.

---

## 🔹 **5. Legacy Without Ego**

Forget fame. Think **seed.**
Ask:

> “What small truth, beauty, or healing can I plant that may grow after I’m gone?”

It could be:

* A piece of writing that touches one life.
* A younger person you mentor or protect.
* A system you improve so others suffer less.

Even your suffering can be transformed into medicine for someone else.

## Would you like a **personalized version** of this weekly practice, based on your current situation (bench time, obsession, anxiety, etc.)? I can write it out like a spiritual calendar, simple and tailored for you.

im afraid of chasing the wrong things in life, it made me inaction and indifference towards anything

Excellent. Let's create a **weekly soul structure** built specifically around your longing for **truth**—not productivity, not perfection, but *honest engagement with life*, one small act at a time.

This structure is designed to be:

* **Simple**: Minimal commitment, low risk of burnout.
* **Grounded**: Oriented toward truth—your real feelings, not performance.
* **Revealing**: It helps you discover what *actually* matters to you through action, not overthinking.

### 📅 **Daily Rhythm (5–30 mins per day)**

| Day                                | Soul Practice                     | Why It Matters |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Mon**                            | **Sit with Yourself** (5–10 mins) |                |
| No distractions. Just sit and ask: |                                   |                |

> “What truth have I been avoiding?”
When someone asks me what I do in my free time, I feel anxious—I never know what to say. I'm afraid of being truly known. The truth is, I don't really have hobbies in the conventional sense. I just spend most of my time on the internet, searching for things, trying to focus—but not really knowing what to focus on.

Sometimes I prepare an answer like, "My hobby is simple: it's either gambling or philosophizing." It's all a metaphor, of course. By "gambling," I mean I'm always looking for ways to get rich quickly, because deep down, I crave freedom and independence. I explore the stock market, crypto, or anything that might offer a chance. I've tried following quant workflows or using AI for trading, but honestly, nothing really works. Most of the time, I'm just speculating. Still, I haven’t lost much—I'm very risk-averse and, frankly, lucky. Most of my assets are in Indonesia's Sukuk, with the rest spread across stocks, crypto, sharia-compliant P2P lending, and fixed income mutual funds.

As for "philosophizing," I'm self-taught and driven by curiosity. I read philosophical texts and follow Fahruddin Faiz’s Ngaji Filsafat. I’ve read Nietzsche, Peter Thiel, Cak Nun, [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]], and explored topics like psychology, anthropology, and history—whatever sparks my interest. I also like tinkering with tech, using my Linux laptop to explore and experiment, always searching for projects that tie everything together and keep the boredom away.

But when someone asks me about my free time, I hesitate to share all this. I’m afraid of being misunderstood or seen as narcissistic. I often assume it’s hard to find someone who shares my interests, so I hold back and give a safe, vague answer instead. Deep down, though, I yearn to meet someone who gets it—someone who understands.

There’s still a lot I haven’t written here, because it would take too long. But that’s a glimpse into who I am.

> Write it down—no filter. | Truth often whispers. We must learn to *listen without fixing*. |
> \| **Tue** | **One True Act**
> Do one small thing aligned with what you know is true—even if no one sees it.
> Examples: Say no. Apologize. Be silent. Start a book. | Integrity is built in quiet moments, not grand gestures. |
> \| **Wed** | **Shadow Journal**
> Write the ugliest or most irrational thoughts in your mind. Then ask:
> “What part of me is crying out?” | This is where guilt becomes insight, and obsession becomes compassion. |
> \| **Thu** | **Create Without Purpose**
> Write, sketch, speak, or build something *not for outcome*—only for honesty. | The soul needs space to speak where the ego isn’t watching. |
> \| **Fri** | **Truth Inventory**
> Ask:

* What felt real this week?
* What felt fake or forced?
* What do I need more of / less of? | Reflecting weekly helps align your life slowly with truth. No rush. |
  \| **Sat** | **Authentic Connection**
  Spend 1 hour in genuine conversation—no small talk. If not possible, write a letter to someone you respect (send or don’t). | Truth shared is truth amplified. |
  \| **Sun** | **Long Walk (Tech-Free)**
  No music, no phone. Walk aimlessly. Let your thoughts flow. Ask:

> “If I weren’t afraid, what would I try?” | Movement + silence opens the deepest layers of the psyche. |

### 🧭 **Monthly Reflection (Pick 1 Day per Month)**

Ask and write:

* Where in my life am I performing rather than participating?
* What truth did I live this month?
* What truth did I betray?
* What is quietly asking to be born in me?

Optional: Burn the page or tear it up after—truth sometimes wants release, not analysis.

---

### 🧘‍♂️ **Rules of Engagement**

* You don’t have to be productive—you just have to be **present**.
* If you skip a day, *don’t judge*. Just begin again.
* If something makes you feel **more alive or more honest**, write it down. These are clues from your deeper self.

Would you like this in a **printable weekly journal format** (PDF or Notion style), or embedded with habit-tracking tools or calendar integration? I can prepare that for you next.
