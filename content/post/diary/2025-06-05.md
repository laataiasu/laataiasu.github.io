my plan is to prepare for job desc in flip, seems like interesting because its mentioning AI and analytics engineering. but im just exploring the tools, try to simulate pubsub an dbigquery in local, but no output. im just slacking and dont know what i do.

i cook chicken and noodle at night, its so stink because i was stemming the chiken in my room, but the taste was so good. 

watching porn because cant hold myself someone mentioning nicole aniston. i think shes the GOAT porn star. her acting is so nice and perfect. 

regret it because tomorrow is idul adha. 

thr worst thing about porn is it made you hard to focus, it made you addicted to other shitty things like scrolling twitter, reddit, or anything, i even download tiktok again because i fear of missing of tiktok shop. its so cheap but it ruins tokpedia, i know. 

but i still dont know how to escape frmo porn. the access is too easy. even when i try to block everything, i always curious about the development of jav. west is boring, except good stories from alex adams, but jav is so i dont know how to describe but its so excited to see the stars, my favourite is rei kamiki for now. 

i hate myself, fuck porn, i agree with billie eilish that porn is ruuning her life. but til now i dont know how to escape. 

yesterday or when, i forgot, but my female coworker nosy to me. i dont know whether it is flirting or not, shes beautiful, average i think, but i see her as beautiful. i try to talk to her but were incompatible. we even met each other at bumble, but looking at her profile doesnt make me interest. 

i dont know why but i need a girl who is passionate about what they do, not only think about themselves, but think big for her self or for the world. but honestly i dont know. maybe its just limmerence, i love the idea of her only. and im afraid to make her hurt. because i know what i need is mostly casual relationship just to hide my loneliness, but in the future, i believe i dont want her. yes, i am bad guy. but yeah, honestly i feel like im the bad guy. i am very avoidant to her, and shes not that good either i think, i am afraid that i cant accept someone completely as them. i always expect something high of someone, it really made me hate myself. because it means i always depends on the external instead of myself, it made me hoping, and not accepting others the way they are. 

but honestly i want to engineering their view. i need to build something, but i dont know what or why. for now im just trying to build system first.
