I have talked with a Gojek driver.

We talked about the Gojek and Grab merger, then suddenly delved into politics.

I asked him which candidate is supported by most of his circle.

He said either Candidate 1 or Candidate 2.

It makes sense since it's in Jabar.

He also asked me about my choice.

I answered that I follow recommendations from academia ðŸ’€.

There's no evidence that there is a best candidate, but the worst is obvious, based on my personal subjective choice.

He suggested me to pick a leader that can't be swayed.

I told him to watch Dirty Votes, even though I haven't watched it yet ðŸ’€.

## Update 2024-02-14

I've watched it; we're done.

Money politics wins; a war criminal is my president, a nepo baby is my vice president.

But I try to lower my bias or assumptions.

I hope their groups are not as bad as what I imagine.
