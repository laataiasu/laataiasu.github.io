Today, I decided to jot down my college activities. It's like something I've never experienced before. When it comes to adaptation, I used to think it was easy. Therefore, I underestimated the facilities provided by the university, such as the regional student association and student orientation time. I underrated those things, and now I regret it.

Initially, I tried to adapt as hard as I could and completed the assignments given by the seniors for the student orientation time in my faculty. But I did that just to complete the assignment; I didn't seek the essence of the program. Then, while everyone else found their peer groups or circles, I found myself alone during my academic time. I do have a friend, but he is introverted and much smarter than me. Although I'm introverted too, he is significantly smarter, making it challenging for me to balance our interactions.

Even today, I still feel [[Anxiety|anxious]] about it. When I don't have any friends to talk to, I walk alone with a sad expression on my face, unable to focus on academics because I underestimated the facilities provided by the university. Now, I'm just hoping for a friend who understands me and can support me. I always pray to God for a good friend who will accompany me whenever I need, even if I don't speak to them. Amen.
