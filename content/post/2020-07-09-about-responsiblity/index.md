title: Responsibility and Expectations of Sap
---

It was a trivial thing, but as someone who loves drama so much, with ingredients it can be something valuable, while as a rational man, it is reputed as shit representing something vague and vulnerable. Nothing is rational; it is just someone who loves roleplay as someone who knows better than others. So, as a cynic rational man, even I doubt myself as it is, sometimes I take a side of a dramatical view and am full of stupidity, or maybe you can call it philosophy if you still want to be looked at as a rational person.

Actually, I couldn’t write the story of it. To tell your unimportant story and waste anybody’s time is a culprit's thing. I am sorry that I just don’t want to be a culprit even maybe I was one of them.

But god, seriously, I hate those words so much...
“I BELIEVE IN YOU.”
It's sort of an optimistic action without any proof and reason, and it is only supported by prejudice. Of course, it can be profitable for those lucky gamblers, speculators, or risk-takers. But as a scientist and decision-maker, it really contravenes with empiricism. And shit, I hate those words so much.
