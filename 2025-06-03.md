its so hard living consistently or in a discipline way in indonesia. you always find a little instability from anything around you. anything need cost. even just want to have comfortable sleep is hard, like when my neighbor comes inconsistently, so noisy, disturbing my sleeping rhytm randomly, need to high cost to get comfortable room and it doesnt guarantee comfort. and if you surrender and bargain, its hard to collect and to build financial soverignty especially when you just started after graduating from college and have no clue about how to get more money. in the developing country, its such a privilledge when you can do anything you want. the information asymmetrics is just too high. the informal works is too high, the data from government is mostly garbaged, nothing can be trust. you see how poor indonesian is in the data, but the truth is very different with the data, there are some who extremely poor beyond data, there are also who is very rich that i can compare with me. i see my friends's lifestyle also, from friend from elementary school to college, the gaps are just too much different. i see most can afford high lifestyle, but i dont know the real about them. or maybe they can manage their asset better than me to so they can be looked as rich. but the thing is its very hard to measure my position right now. i know i think am loser because i care more about position. but the thing is i dont know what i really want. so in order to help me to get what i want, i need to know my position first. but i think all of these are happened because im too afraid of my shadow. carl jung said that we need to integrate our shadow with me. i assume myself want to be the best in everything, i strive for it, i want truth, love, money, beauty, power. but perhaps all of it is not something really what i want. perhaps im just empty, and i dont know to make myself fulfill. i try everything i can to distract myself. lots of options, should i leave my work or should i stay. is it worth to tell the truth to my family. is it worth to date with a girl. actually i am really afraid. because i know about arrival fallacy. most of what i achieved, after sometime i realized its not what i really want. i dont know whether is it growth or something i really want or need. i try to collect everything as long as i can be better. but honestly i cant really decide whats right for me. all im doing is just daydreaming and contemplating.

i forgot what science branch is it. but it is said that modern people are to consume much informational content, think too much and feel to little. the research shows that we got too much pain mentally so we need more transfer our energy to physical pain or to sing/scream our voice. i forgot the branch of the science or any terms related to it, or books related to it.

human are too arrogant to claim only them are capable of beauty and meaning. AI offend ego most of artist, even hayao miyazaki is a luddite.

ish kariman au mutsyahidan. living gloriously or die as a martyr. we both compete and collaborate with ai. if they can do better without us, we better die beautifully as a martyr.
