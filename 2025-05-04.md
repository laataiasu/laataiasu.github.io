when i try scaling my tooth, i have just realized im very bad at multitasking

at first i opened my eyes to see the process while trying to hold the water not get into my kerongkongan and keep my breathing.

i struggling a lot. it made the dokter gigi kesal, because i try to pause a lot because i think the water goes into my tenggorokan ruining my breath.

after seeing they kesal with me, i try to close my eyes. 

try to focus only to breathing and hold the water from get into my tenggorokan, and actually i find the rhytm, and it made me comfortable.

i dont know if its realted to multi tasking, but closing my eyes really improve the process.

--- 

the thing that i actually i have realize from before is, i am very bad at multitasking. 

i can do multitasking, but only at the level that has lower value. 

multi tasking, context switching is bad, it only works for tasks that produce low value.

i believe activity that produce high quality value require focus and not multask.

human cant be like computer that can process things paralelly. 

there always be something that need to be sacrificed when you try that. 

and if you can multitask, it means you just engage in low value activity. 

i need to get rid of work that require multi tasking.

most operational, support, service desk level task requires multitasking

im just curious whether theres anyone that like those kind of work.

if not, i just pray that anyone can get out of living in survival mode and get rid of multitask meaningless works, especially myself.

### On Multitasking and a Visit to the Dentist

When I tried scaling my teeth, I realized something important: I’m really bad at multitasking.

At first, I kept my eyes open to observe the procedure, while also trying to prevent water from going down my esophagus/throat and managing my breathing. It was overwhelming. I struggled a lot. The dentist became visibly frustrated because I kept pausing the process—I felt like water was getting into my throat, making it hard to breathe.

Noticing their irritation, I decided to close my eyes. I shifted my focus entirely to just two things: breathing and keeping the water out of my throat. Surprisingly, once I let go of the need to “see” and just focused, I found a rhythm. I became more relaxed, and the process went much more smoothly.

I’m not sure if this is directly related to multitasking, but closing my eyes and focusing made a noticeable difference.

This experience reminded me of something I’ve known for a while: I’m not good at multitasking. I *can* multitask, but only when the tasks are low-stakes or low-value.

In general, I believe multitasking and constant context switching are detrimental. They may be acceptable for shallow tasks, but high-quality, meaningful work requires deep focus. We're not like computers that can truly process things in parallel. There’s always a trade-off. Something gets sacrificed.

If you're able to multitask easily, it probably means you're not doing anything that produce high value that demands true focus.

I need to reduce the kind of work that forces me to multitask. 
Most operational, support, or service-desk-type jobs require constant multitasking. 
I wonder if there are people who genuinely enjoy that kind of work. 

If not, I hope we all—myself included—can move beyond survival mode and into work that feels more meaningful, with fewer distractions and less fragmentation.
