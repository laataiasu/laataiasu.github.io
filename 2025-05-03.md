this is the day when i lost hope in humanity (my software engineer engineer friend never touch linux in his life)

windows known in providing lots of infra for israel, some said for unethical used in war. even though the profit is not really that big, but it still. i dont know. 

in pantry we talked a lot about the economic condition, we're so miserable that felt like we can never buy a house. we need more than 20 years to save money with our current wage. and my college said he can just save for about a million rupiahs. looking at this i dont believes, sometimes people exaggerate their misery, or maybe their being honest i never know the real motive of human lie or truth.

most if it is just fear. for me honestly. i budget myself to spend max 3 million rupiahs. so i can save mostly around 50-75 percent of my wage, its not including my investment which has up and down too. but what im really curious is, i see them as rich people, spend their money on good fashion and when buying foods they never consider the price. i dont know the lifestyle of people. and the outside is often lie. i dont know which part is they're lies. 

and when i have a very skeptical about someone in real life. i should have high sceptical as well on the internet. but yet in the past i trust too much, all bad conditions from news, from reddit sub depression and suicidewatch. i see those kind of subreddit is very active. everyday everyhour in another part of the world there always someone who really want to die. and yesterday i believe it rawly. and now i try to have my skeptical, and to try to be more ignorant. ignorant of negative and miserable people. 

i need to be evil, i stress that everyday to myself.

id be cold as a stone and rich as fool that turns all those good hearts away~
