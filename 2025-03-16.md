actually theres no such thing called as lie, its only misunderstood about incomplete statement. the premise is nothing is complete. you bound your understanding based on assumptions and bias from what you know, you are dictated by the language. grammar and language itself is human creation that is created to simplify things, to limit human. 

when someone speak untrue, you could only verify by langauge you speak and understand. theres so many language and time and space you dont know. when someone lie about something that is not exists in the present, it could be true in the future, or in the past, or in another dimension. when you say someone is lying, you only see from the perspective of the present and from your current limited knowledge.

its like when god in islam is saying, “Dan sesungguhnya telah Kami mudahkan Alquran untuk pelajaran, maka adakah orang yang mengambil pelajaran?” (QS. Al-Qamar: 17). yet when few m*slim become terrorist because they find ayat that legitimate their intention, other muslims can easily said, the terrorist are misinterpret the ayat, it is not like that. doesnt realize it shows the flaw of that ayat. how i conclude, simplify, and generalize this things is the example of how most human value anything. were very limited by our own view. 

thats why i believe lying is doesnt exist, it is just because we are misunderstood of something, because everything is basicallly incomplete.

Actually, there’s no such thing as a "lie." What we often call a lie is simply a misunderstanding or an incomplete statement. The premise behind this is that nothing is truly complete. Our understanding is shaped by assumptions, biases, and the limits of our knowledge. Language itself is a human construct, created to simplify communication but inherently limiting in how it shapes our perception of the world.

When someone says something untrue, we can only verify it within the confines of the language we speak and the knowledge we have. There are countless languages, times, and spaces beyond our comprehension. For example, if someone makes a statement about something that doesn't exist in the present, it may very well be true in the future, in the past, or even in a different dimension. What we perceive as a "lie" often arises from our limited perspective, confined to the present moment and the knowledge we currently possess.

Consider the way historical events are often interpreted differently by different cultures or societies. For instance, the way the history of a war is told might vary significantly depending on the side you were on or the historical context. One person’s account of events might be seen as truthful to them, while another could see it as a distortion. Does this mean one of them is lying? Or does it simply mean that both perspectives are incomplete, shaped by different experiences and worldviews?

A similar example can be seen in religion. In Islam, the Qur’an says, “And We have certainly made the Qur’an easy to remember, so is there anyone who will be reminded?” (Q.S. Al-Qamar: 17). However, some Muslims interpret certain verses to justify extreme actions, such as terrorism. Other Muslims may immediately claim that these extremists have misunderstood or misinterpreted the verses. But this reaction itself is an example of how language and understanding can be inherently flawed. The very existence of conflicting interpretations suggests that the text—though considered complete by some—is actually incomplete in its ability to fully convey meaning without ambiguity. The flaw lies not in the intention of the message, but in the limitations of human interpretation.

Similarly, if we look at the way different people perceive the concept of "truth," we can see how subjective and limited our understanding is. Two people can witness the same event and recount it in entirely different ways. One person might say, "I saw a red car," while another might say, "I saw a car, but I’m not sure of the color—it might have been blue." Which one is "lying"? The car could have been a mixture of colors, the lighting could have been different, or one person may have been distracted. The truth, in this case, is not fixed, but rather shaped by each individual's perception.

Therefore, I believe the concept of lying is an illusion. It stems from our misunderstanding of something that is inherently incomplete. The truth we claim to know is often just a small fragment of a much larger, more complex reality. Everything we experience, from conversations to historical events to religious texts, is subject to the limitations of our perspective. This is why communication and understanding are so challenging: we are constantly trying to make sense of the world using tools—language, logic, and assumptions—that are inherently incomplete.

The idea that there is no such thing as a "lie" challenges the conventional notion of truth and falsehood. It suggests that what we often perceive as a lie is simply a result of our own limited understanding and incomplete knowledge. The concept of truth becomes fluid, ever-changing, and subjective, depending on the individual and their unique perspective on the world.

In conclusion, what we call lying is often just a misunderstanding of incomplete information. Everything we think we know is based on limited knowledge, and our language—designed to simplify and communicate—inevitably shapes how we interpret the world. Thus, lying, as a concept, may not truly exist in the absolute sense, but instead reflects the complexities and limitations of human understanding.
