The government only needs to monitor and prevent physical contact. The government only takes action when there is a conflict involving physical violence between groups.\nIf one group considers another group misguided, the government can allow it because it’s not a big deal.

While voyeurism is considered bad, it is now normalized in business. Essentially, people are being the target of voyeuristic all the time, but they close their eyes and numb themselves, or they don’t realize that they enjoy being under surveillance because only then can they feel like they’re getting what they desire and being taught how to desire every day.\nBut we can always gaslight ourselves. Giving our data is part of sodaqoh and charity in Islam. And we trust others perfectly as we have faith in Allah, especially businessmen, that we believe they will hide our aib if we have.
