Here are some of the key takeaways from this transformative period:\nNeuro-Coupling: One of the most intriguing concepts I learned about during this time was neuro-coupling. This idea suggests that our brains have the remarkable ability to synchronize with one another, allowing for deep connections and understanding between individuals. By recognizing the power of neuro-coupling, I became more aware of the importance of genuine and empathetic communication in building strong relationships.\nAvoiding Self-Absorption: I realized that being overly self-absorbed can hinder personal growth and damage relationships. It’s essential to strike a balance between self-care and being mindful of the needs and experiences of others. This shift in perspective helped me become a more compassionate and empathetic person.\nThe 621 Rule for Habit Maintenance: The “621” rule, which suggests it takes 21 days to build a habit, and 6 months to make it a part of your lifestyle, became a guiding principle for me. It reminded me of the importance of patience and consistency when trying to incorporate positive habits into my daily routine.\nThe 20% Project at Google: The concept of the “20% project” at Google taught me the value of allowing employees to pursue their passions and interests alongside their regular work. This idea encouraged creativity and innovation, and I began to apply it to my own life, allocating time for personal projects and creative pursuits.\nEmbracing Feedback: I learned that those who are afraid of feedback are often limiting their growth potential. Constructive criticism can be a powerful tool for personal and professional development. Embracing feedback and using it as a stepping stone to improvement became a mantra in my journey.\nCultivating a Courage Habit: I embarked on a journey to cultivate a “courage habit.” This included various practices:\nAccessing the Body: I dedicated 5 minutes a day to body scanning, which helped me connect with my physical sensations and emotions, leading to greater self-awareness.\nListening Without Attachment: I practiced listening to others without judgment or attachment to my own thoughts and opinions, fostering deeper connections and understanding.\nReframing Limiting Stories: I worked on recognizing and reframing the limiting stories I told myself, replacing them with more empowering narratives that encouraged personal growth.\nCreating Community: I actively reached out and worked on building a supportive community of like-minded individuals who shared my values and goals. This network provided encouragement and accountability.\nBuilding Rapport: Finally, I learned the art of building rapport with others. Whether in personal or professional relationships, the ability to establish trust and connection through effective communication and understanding is a valuable skill that I honed during this period.\nIn conclusion, the months from August to December 2022 were a time of profound growth and self-discovery. These lessons, ranging from neuro-coupling and self-awareness to habit-building and the value of feedback, have left an indelible mark on my journey towards personal and professional development. They continue to guide me as I strive to become a better, more empathetic, and courageous individual.\nPrinciples of influence: Contrast Principle: The contrast principle refers to the psychological phenomenon where people tend to perceive differences more prominently when presented with contrasting options. This principle is often used in sales and marketing contexts. For example, if you present a more expensive product first, followed by a moderately priced one, the moderately priced item may appear more affordable than it would have if presented alone. The contrast between the two prices influences the perception of value for the second item.\nSocial Proof: Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people look to the actions and behaviors of others in a given situation to determine their own actions. This principle is based on the idea that if others are doing something, it must be the right thing to do. Social proof can be seen in various contexts, such as testimonials in advertising, online product reviews, or the tendency to follow popular trends and behaviors.\nWerther Effect: The Werther Effect, also known as copycat suicide, is a social phenomenon where there is an increase in suicide rates following media coverage or publicized instances of suicide. The term originates from the novel “The Sorrows of Young Werther” by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in which the main character’s suicide leads to a series of similar suicides. The Werther Effect highlights the influence of media and social contagion on suicidal behaviors.\nLiking: The Friendly Thief: In the context of influence, the principle of liking suggests that people are more likely to comply with requests or be influenced by those whom they like or feel a connection to. The “Friendly Thief” is a metaphorical representation of someone who, despite their wrongdoings (in this case, being a thief), is likable or charming. People might overlook or forgive their actions because they find the person appealing. This principle is often used in sales and persuasion strategies, where building rapport and creating positive relationships can increase the likelihood of successful influence.\nTupperware Party: The Tupperware party is a marketing and sales strategy that became popular in the mid-20th century. It involves a social gathering hosted by someone (usually a friend, family member, or acquaintance) at their home, where a representative from the Tupperware company demonstrates and sells Tupperware products to attendees. The social environment, combined with demonstrations and peer influence, creates a powerful context for the principle of social proof and liking, leading to increased sales.\nSCARCITY: The Rule of the Few: The principle of scarcity suggests that people perceive items or opportunities that are scarce as more valuable and desirable. The “Rule of the Few” refers to the idea that when something is limited or available to only a select few, it increases its perceived worth. For example, limited edition products, exclusive offers, or time-limited deals often tap into the scarcity principle to encourage people to make quicker decisions and take advantage of the opportunity before it’s gone.\nThese principles of influence are widely studied and applied in marketing, sales, psychology, and various other fields to understand and predict human behavior, decision-making, and responses to different stimuli.\n","wordCount":"1041","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2022-12-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"laataiasu"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/post/2022-12-31-insights-lessons-i-got-this-year/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Laataiasu","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/archives/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Insights and Lessons from This Year</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 31, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1041 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;laataiasu</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#principles-of-influence>Principles of influence:</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>During the period of August 2022 to December 2022, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth, and I encountered several valuable insights and lessons that have had a profound impact on my life.
