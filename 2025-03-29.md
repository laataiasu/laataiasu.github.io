it was the day when i travel from semarang to yogyakarta using motorcycle...

its fucked up actually, as ive said before, i feel like my decision making skills is pretty bad. i went from 3 pm and arrieved at yk at 6 pm. at yk i am too shy to go to my grandma's house. so broke my fast at random masjid near my grandma's house. ny father called me and ask where do i stay for sleep. i said im looking for a homestay. i am looking for homestay and couldnt get any. i dont know what i am doing but time flies so fast until 9 pm i just look for rent/dorm/homestay. and when i desperate, i ask my friend where he stay. and when i in my lowest time, the miracle is appeared suddenly. at around 11 pm my friend said actually he got a homestay. my battery is 5% the road is so dark. and i actually arrieved at my dorm. he is like my saver, and it always shown to me that my decision skill is bad, its often because of luck that i got something good. on the one hand i feel grateful, OTOH, i really mad because its just shown me that i am a lack of agency, i feel like i have no free wil or consciousness. it felt automatic, i cant control my fate. and then in 12pm we went to itikaf at ugm. i cant sleep. i get jealous for someone that can sleep easily
